## Unofficial Auto Downloader for  FlightSimLabs aircraft

I developed this because it is always a pain to go fishing through emails for your serial key and product key (3+ times) each time FlightSimLabs release an update, and also it was a fun quick project to work on.

This tool will do the following:
- Automatically read your licence information from your Windows registry.
- Submit the form on https://redownload.flightsimlabs.com behind the scenes for you.
- Start downloading into your Downloads folder.

You will need to manually open the .zip and install them yourself, but this takes away the most painful part.

There are no guarantees on the stability of this tool, it isn't very resilient as it just works on my machine which was the end goal.

### Use at your own risk. At this stage I will not provide any support for this.

Feel free to take this and modify it further, perhaps even configure it to automatically run the installers!

I have no affiliation with FlightSimLabs and as I have tried to make clear throughout the various names, this is not an official piece of software. That said, I hope you find some use of this.
